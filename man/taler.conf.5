.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The basic structure of the configuration file is the following. The file
is split into sections. Every section begins with “[SECTIONNAME]” and
contains a number of options of the form “OPTION=VALUE”. Empty lines and
lines beginning with a “#” are treated as comments. Files containing
default values for many of the options described below are installed
under $TALER_PREFIX/share/taler/config.d/. The configuration file given
with \fB\-c\fP to Taler binaries overrides these defaults.
.SS Global Options
.sp
The following options are from the “[taler]” section and used by
virtually all Taler components.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B CURRENCY
Name of the currency, i.e.\ “EUR” for Euro.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The “[PATHS]” section is special in that it contains paths that can be
referenced using “$” in other configuration values that specify
filenames. For Taler, it commonly contains the following paths:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B TALER_HOME
Home directory of the user, usually “${HOME}”. Can be overwritten by
testcases by setting ${TALER_TEST_HOME}.
.TP
.B TALER_DATA_HOME
Where should Taler store its long\-term data. Usually
“${TALER_HOME}/.local/share/taler/”
.TP
.B TALER_CONFIG_HOME
Where is the Taler configuration kept. Usually
“${TALER_HOME}/.config/taler/”
.TP
.B TALER_CACHE_HOME
Where should Taler store cached data. Usually
“${TALER_HOME}/.cache/taler/”
.TP
.B TALER_RUNTIME_DIR
Where should Taler store system runtime data (like UNIX domain
sockets). Usually “${TMP}/taler\-system\-runtime”.
.UNINDENT
.SS EXCHANGE OPTIONS
.sp
The following options are from the “[exchange]” section and used by most
exchange tools.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B DB
Plugin to use for the database, i.e.\ “postgres”
.TP
.B PORT
Port on which the HTTP server listens, i.e.\ 8080.
.TP
.B MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY
Crockford Base32\-encoded master public key, public version of the
exchange\'s long\-time offline signing key.
.TP
.B MASTER_PRIV_FILE
Location of the master private key on disk. Only used by tools that
can be run offline (as the master key is for offline signing).
.TP
.B BASE_URL
Specifies the base URL under which the exchange can be reached. Added
to wire transfers to enable tracking by merchants.
.TP
.B AGGREGATOR_IDLE_SLEEP_INTERVAL
For how long should the aggregator sleep when it is idle before trying
to look for more work? Default is 60 seconds.
.TP
.B SIGNKEY_DURATION
For how long is a signing key valid?
.TP
.B LEGAL_DURATION
For how long are signatures with signing keys legally valid?
.TP
.B LOOKAHEAD_SIGN
How long do we generate denomination and signing keys ahead of time?
.TP
.B LOOKAHEAD_PROVIDE
How long into the future do we provide signing and denomination keys
to clients?
.TP
.B TERMS_DIR
Directory where the terms of service of the exchange operator can be fund. The directory must contain sub\-directories for every supported language, using the two\-character language code in lower case, i.e. "en/" or "fr/".  Each subdirectory must then contain files with the terms of service in various formats.  The basename of the file of the current policy must be specified under TERMS_ETAG.  The extension defines the mime type. Supported extensions include "html", "htm", "txt", "pdf", "jpg", "jpeg", "png" and "gif".  For example, using a TERMS_ETAG of "0", the structure could be the following:
\- $TERMS_DIR/en/0.pdf
\- $TERMS_DIR/en/0.html
\- $TERMS_DIR/en/0.txt
\- $TERMS_DIR/fr/0.pdf
\- $TERMS_DIR/fr/0.html
\- $TERMS_DIR/de/0.txt
.TP
.B TERMS_ETAG
Basename of the file(s) in the TERMS_DIR with the current terms of service.  The value is also used for the "Etag" in the HTTP request to control caching. Whenever the terms of service change, the TERMS_ETAG MUST also change, and old values MUST NOT be repeated.  For example, the date or version number of the terms of service SHOULD be used for the Etag.  If there are minor (i.e. spelling) fixes to the terms of service, the TERMS_ETAG probably SHOULD NOT be changed. However, whenever users must approve the new terms, the TERMS_ETAG MUST change.
.TP
.B PRIVACY_DIR
Works the same as TERMS_DIR, just for the privacy policy.
.TP
.B PRIVACY_ETAG
Works the same as TERMS_ETAG, just for the privacy policy.
.UNINDENT
.SS EXCHANGE DATABASE OPTIONS

.B DURATION_OVERLAP
How much should validity periods for coins overlap?
Should be long enough to avoid problems with
wallets picking one key and then due to network latency
another key being valid.  The DURATION_WITHDRAW period
must be longer than this value.
.TP
.B IDLE_RESERVE_EXPIRATION_TIME
After which time period should reserves be closed if they are idle?
.TP
.B LEGAL_RESERVE_EXPIRATION_TIME
After what time do we forget about (drained) reserves during garbage collection?
