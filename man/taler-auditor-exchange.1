.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBtaler\-auditor\-exchange\fP is a command line tool to be used by an
auditor to add or remove an exchange from the list of exchange’s audited
by the auditor. You must add an exchange to that list before signing
denomination keys with taler\-auditor\-sign or trying to audit it with
taler\-auditor or taler\-wire\-auditor. Afterwards the exchange will be
visible via the /exchanges API of the taler\-auditor\-httpd.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-m\fP \fIMASTERKEY\fP | \fB–exchange\-key=\fP‌\fIMASTERKEY\fP
Public key of the exchange in Crockford base32 encoding, for example
as generated by gnunet\-ecc \-p.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP | \fB–help\fP
Print short help on options.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP \fIEXCHANGE_URL\fP | \fB–auditor\-url=\fP‌\fIEXCHANGE_URL\fP
URL of the exchange. The exchange’s HTTP API must be available at
this address.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP | \fB–remove\fP
Instead of adding the exchange, remove it. Note that this will drop
ALL data associated with that exchange, including existing auditing
information. So use with extreme care!

.SH BUGS
.sp
We should optionally verify the correctness of this exchange’s base URL
and that it matches the master public key (note that the exchange may
still be offline, so it should be possible to bypass such a verfication
step). Furthermore, if we do verification, as a (less secure)
convenience option, we should make \fB\-\fP m optional and obtain it from
the base URL.
