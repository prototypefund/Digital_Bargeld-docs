.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBtaler\-auditor\-sign\fP is a command line tool to be used by an auditor
to sign that he is aware of certain keys being used by a exchange. Using
this signature, the auditor affirms that he will verify that the
exchange is properly accounting for those coins.
.sp
The exchange for which keys were signed must have been added to the
auditor using taler\-auditor\-exchange first!
