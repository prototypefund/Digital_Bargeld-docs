\fBtaler\-auditor\fP \- audit exchange
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBtaler\-auditor\fP [\fB\-h\fP\ |\ \fB–help\fP]
[\fB\-m\fP\ \fIMASTER_KEY\fP\ |\ \fB–exchange\-key=\fP‌\fIMASTER_KEY\fP]
[\fB\-r\fP\ |\ \fB–reset\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBtaler\-auditor\fP is a command line tool to be used by an auditor to
audit an exchange’s database and calculate the current financial state
of the exchange (including revenue, amount expected in escrow and risk
exposure). The audit is incremental. The first audit must be performed
with the \fB\-r\fP option to initialize the tables. The tool reports
inconsistencies in the balance or incorrect cryptographic signatures
found in the database. It does NOT check with the bank to see that the
incoming and outgoing wire transfers that the bank claims to have
matches the exchange’s database. Its options are as follows.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-h\fP | \fB–help\fP
Print short help on options.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP \fIKEY\fP | \fB–exchange\-key=\fP‌\fIKEY\fP
Public master key of the exchange in Crockford base32 encoding, for
example as generated by gnunet\-ecc \-p. If this option is missing,
taler\-auditor will use the MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY value from the
“exchange” section of the configuration.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP | \fB–reset\fP
Reset the audit, starts everything from the beginning. Useful for
testing and required for the first audit to setup auditor’s tables.
Note that if (just) the exchange key changes, the \fB\-r\fP option
should not be used again.
