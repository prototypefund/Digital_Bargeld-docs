.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBtaler\-exchange\-httpd\fP is a command line tool to run the Taler
exchange (HTTP server). The required configuration, keys and database
must exist before running this command.
.sp
Its options are as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-C\fP | \fB–connection\-close\fP
Force each HTTP connection to be closed after each request (useful in
combination with \fB\-f\fP to avoid having to wait for nc to time out).
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIFILENAME\fP | \fB–config=\fP‌\fIFILENAME\fP
Use the configuration and other resources for the merchant to operate
from FILENAME.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP | \fB–help\fP
Print short help on options.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP | \fB–init\-db\fP
Initialize the database by creating tables and indices if necessary.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP | \fB–version\fP
Print version information.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP \fIFILENAME\fP | \fB–file\-input=\fP‌\fIFILENAME\fP
This option is only available if the exchange was compiled with the
configure option –enable\-developer\-mode. It is used for generating
test cases against the exchange using AFL. When this option is
present, the HTTP server will
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
terminate after the first client’s HTTP connection is completed,
and
.IP 2. 3
automatically start such a client using a helper process based on
the nc(1) or ncat(1) binary using FILENAME as the standard input
to the helper process.
.UNINDENT
.sp
As a result, the process will effectively run with \fIFILENAME\fP as the
input from an HTTP client and then immediately exit. This is useful
to test taler\-exchange\-httpd against many different possible inputs
in a controlled way.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP \fISECONDS\fP | \fB–timeout=\fP‌\fISECONDS\fP
Specifies the number of SECONDS after which the HTTPD should close
(idle) HTTP connections.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP \fILOGLEVEL\fP | \fB–loglevel=\fP‌\fILOGLEVEL\fP
Specifies the log level to use. Accepted values are: DEBUG, INFO,
WARNING, ERROR.
.UNINDENT
.SH SIGNALS
.sp
\fBtaler\-exchange\-httpd\fP responds to the following signals:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBSIGUSR1\fP
Sending a SIGUSR1 to the process will cause it to reload denomination
and signing keys.
.TP
.B \fBSIGTERM\fP
Sending a SIGTERM to the process will cause it to shutdown cleanly.
.TP
.B \fBSIGHUP\fP
Sending a SIGHUP to the process will cause it to re\-execute the
taler\-exchange\-httpd binary in the PATH, passing it the existing
listen socket. Then the old server process will automatically exit
after it is done handling existing client connections; the new server
process will accept and handle new client connections.
